# ODMR for NV and SnV centers in diamond
This framework provides a model to simulate the NV and SnV centers. Majority of the NV ODMR is based on the work done byYuchun Zhu, Elena Losero, Christophe Galland, Valentin Goblot in Simulation of ODMR Spectra from Nitrogen-Vacancy Ensembles in Diamond for Electric Field Sensing. All code is stored under source/.


Some of the main packages required to run these scripts are:
Numpy
MatPlotLib
QuTip
Scipy

For running on a Linux system (Ubuntu), it is often required to run (and install) the following:
sudo apt install python3-tk
pip install PyQt5
